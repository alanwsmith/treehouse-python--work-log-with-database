Treehouse Work Log w/ Database Python Project
=============================================

This is my run at Project 4 from the Treehouse Python/Django course. 

Usage
-----

Run the script with:

    python3 worklog.py


Specs
-----

The specifications for the project are found at:

    https://teamtreehouse.com/projects/work-log-with-a-database

One spec is for:

> As a user of the script, if finding by employee, I should be allowed to enter employee name and then be presented with entries with that employee as their creator. 

I setup a list of employees to choose from instead of a free form text field. This reduces potential problems with mis-spellings. 


PEP8
----

There are a couple PEP8 violations of line length. These are based on the 
way the test suite looks for returned values. Probably fixable, but the 
higher priority is making progress in the course.
